# Assessment Snapshot

Assessment Snapshot is a prototype of a Streamlit app for exploring collections assessment data exported from ArchivesSpace, an open-source collections management system for archives. You can apply specific ratings criteria using the filters on the left, then view summary statistics and assessment records below. If you want to save the matching records, you can download them in a CSV with only the columns you need.

### About the data  

Due to the customizable nature of the ArchivesSpace assessment module and its use as an internal collections management tool, I've used fake data and made some assumptions about how people collect and use it (e.g., surveyed extent units are in cubic feet). I work on this sporadically in my spare time, but in future versions, I'd like to make it possible to upload and view metrics for assessment reports from any ASpace repository.
