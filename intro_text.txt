Libraries, archives, and museums collect data about the stuff on their shelves (and drives) using a type of survey called a *collections assessment*. They use this data to understand their backlogs of "unprocessed" material and make data-informed decisions about which materials they should prioritize for preservation and processing, and how to reduce their backlogs to better serve their users.

This is a prototype of a Streamlit app for exploring collections assessment data exported from ArchivesSpace, an open-source collections management system for archives. You can adjust filters for ratings and survey size using the filters on the left, then view summary statistics for ratings and special formats based on filtered results. You can also view the filtered results themselves, and download the records in a CSV with only the columns you select.
