*Due to the customizable nature of the ArchivesSpace assessment module and its use as an internal collections management tool, I've used fake data and made some assumptions about how people collect and use it (e.g., surveyed extent units are in cubic feet).*

*Get in touch with any feedback at a d g r a y 9 8 7 at gmail dot com. I made this as a labor of love, and I would love to hear from you. If you want to check out or reuse (and improve!) the code, it's [here](https://github.com/adgray987/collections-assessment-app).*
